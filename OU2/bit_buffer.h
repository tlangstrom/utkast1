/**
 * @defgroup bit_buffer_h Bit buffer
 *
 * @brief A data type representing a buffer that can hold bit values.
 *
 * The buffer can hold bit values. The buffer has a direction, single
 * bits or single bytes (8 bits) is inserted in one end of the buffer
 * and single bits or single bytes can be removed from the other end.
 * It also possible to inspect bit values without removing them from
 * the buffer. The buffer dynamically increases it size when needed,
 * it does not dynamically decrease it size.
 *
 * The user is recommended to use an instance of the buffer with either
 * operations (insert/remove) for bits or bytes. If the user want to
 * use an instance of the buffer with both operations (insert/remove)
 * for bits and bytes, the user is recommended to experiment with the
 * buffer to study the behaviour.
